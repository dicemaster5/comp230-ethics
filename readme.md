## Essay Proposal

### Essay question: Do violent Video Games lead to Violence?

For my essay I want to look into seeing if "violent" video actually games make the player want to commit violent acts.

Video games have always been rooted into being somewhat violent, with most video games having the player trying to "kill" or "attack" things in the game as a main objective.

But there are rarely ever any reports of people acting violent from playing a "violent" video games, yet there are many people who advocate that violent video games are bad and that they make the player want to comit violent acts.
